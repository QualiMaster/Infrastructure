# Infrastructure
This repository contains the QualiMaster (http://qualimaster.eu) infrastructure components, i.e., a set of tools and layers on top of Apache Storm (http://storm.apache.org)
enabling a configurable and adaptive real-time data processing infrastructure. The infrastructure and the running data analysis pipeline for a certain infrastructure
installation can be configured through the QualiMaster infrastructure configuration tool (QM-IConf, https://github.com/QualiMaster/QM-IConf).

The layers and components of the infrastructure will be released incrementally until Spring 2016.

The QualiMaster infrastructure will be released as open source under the Apache 2.0 license.
