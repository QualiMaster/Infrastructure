# Infrastructure
This repository contains the QualiMaster (http://qualimaster.eu) infrastructure components, i.e., a set of tools and layers on top of Apache Storm (http://storm.apache.org)
enabling a configurable and adaptive real-time data processing infrastructure. The infrastructure and the running data analysis pipeline for a certain infrastructure
installation can be configured through the QualiMaster infrastructure configuration tool (QM-IConf, https://github.com/QualiMaster/QM-IConf).

The layers and components of the infrastructure will be released incrementally. The figure below shows an overview of the architecture.

In May 2024, the QualiMaster infrastructure was upgraded to EASy-Producer 1.3.10 and, thereby, to JDK 17 and maven builds.

The QualiMaster infrastructure is open source under the Apache 2.0 license.
